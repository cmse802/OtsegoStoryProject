    "This stacked bar chart provides a breakdown of sentiment categoriesâ€”**Positive**, **Neutral**, and **Negative**â€”for each day of the week using the VADER sentiment scores. It helps visualize how the emotional tone of Facebook posts fluctuates throughout the week. For example, you can observe whether weekends tend to have more positive posts or if certain weekdays see spikes in negativity. The height of each stacked bar represents the total number of posts for that day, while the colored segments indicate how those posts are distributed across the sentiment categories.\n"
