Hey everyone! Just wanted to give an update. We are working to create JFO as a nonprofit. Itâ€™s currently in the works and coming soon. We are still working with the Otsego Story Project team through MSU and working on lots of plans for that. Stay tuned and I will give more detailed updates as I learn more. Thanks for sticking with us. Christina,positive,0.0,0.914,0.086,0.6793

Does anyone here live on Helen Ave. in Otsego that would be willing to let myself and some people working on the Otsego Story Project from MSU get a water sample from your tap that does not have reverse osmosis in your home? We would need to get it between 3-4pm tomorrow on Sunday the 23rd. Sorry this is last minute. Anyone willing to help would be greatly appreciated. If you do not want to volunteer here please feel free to contact me via private message. Thank you so much!!,positive,0.025,0.824,0.151,0.9254

Hi everyone. There have been quite a few requests for more JFO merchandise. There will be another opportunity in the upcoming months. We are going to allow family and friends to grieve and rest. When the store reopens it will be posted here. All proceeds from the merchandise will go to honor Mary through the Mary Zack Scholarship Fund.,positive,0.039,0.796,0.165,0.8126
"In honor and memory of our founder; Mary Zack was born in southwest Michigan and spent her childhood in Otsego. In 1997, at the age of 17, she was diagnosed with stage IV germ cell ovarian cancer, marking a pivotal moment in her life as a member of the class of 1999.In 2018, Mary founded Justice For Otsego after witnessing many of her classmates, family, and friends fall victim to various rare cancers and illnesses. Throughout her journey, she received invaluable support from Erin Brockovich, which helped her delve into the root causes of these health issues affecting the Otsego community. Over the past seven years, Mary has tirelessly uncovered critical information about illegal dumping, pollution, and the methods used to spread toxic waste along county roads. Her findings revealed the presence of harmful substances like PFOS, PFAS, and dioxins, which have likely contributed to the generational health crises in the area, with evidence of toxic waste dumping dating back to the 1960s.As an advocate and activist, Mary maintained her remission until early spring 2022, when she was diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer called KRAS 12-D mutation, which metastasized to her bones, and ultimately resulted in Leptomeningeal disease. Rather than deter her, this diagnosis fueled her determination to seek further answers.Mary collaborated with the Toxic Action Lab at Michigan State University, securing a $500,000 grant to advance research on the health impacts in Otsego and neighboring communities.On March 1, 2025, after a courageous three-year battle with cancer, Mary passed away, leaving behind a powerful legacy aimed at preventing illness and safeguarding the health of future generations in Otsego and beyond.Mary is remembered as a hero and a legend, deeply missed by her family, friends, and the entire community.",negative,0.129,0.759,0.111,-0.7264
